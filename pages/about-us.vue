            We are devoted to nurturing the whole child â€“ intellectually, socially, emotionally, and beyond. It is the core of all we do. By recognizing that no two children are the same, our approach cultivates the unique potential of each and every child in a caring, safe, and supportive school environment.

            The philosophy upon which Arunodaya Montessori School is based embraces the most fundamental teachings of Dr. Maria Montessori. Our method is designed to constantly build upon the individual skills and knowledge the child is acquiring, at every age level. By offering multi-aged classrooms rich with Montessori materials, your child will be actively engaged in their own learning process.

            He or she can move through new challenging materials quickly, or on to another experience without the boredom of waiting for others to catch up. His or her own feelings of accomplishment act as a reinforcement to succeed.
