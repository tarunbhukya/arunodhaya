            <p class="text-lg">Practical Life Exercises are designed to teach children how to carry out everyday activities in a meaningful way. By mastering these exercises, children learn how to control their movements, become more independent, and adapt to their community. It is crucial to focus on teaching the child how to do these activities correctly rather than constantly correcting them. This approach allows the child to become a fully functional member of society. Additionally, Practical Life Exercises can aid in the development of a child's intellect, concentration, and ability to think in an organized manner.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg">The direct aim of Practical Life Exercises is to help children gain independence in basic movements, take care of themselves and their environment, and learn social grace and courtesy. The indirect aim is to promote the development of coordination and lay the foundation for the integration of the child's personality.</p>
