            <p class="text-lg">Language is a system of symbols with an agreed upon meaning that is used by a group of
                people. Language is a means of communication ideas or feelings by the use of conventionalized sounds and
                signs, thus, being the spoken and written language. Children can learn up to seven languages in the first
                six years of their lives. We introduce reading to children in three stages where they first mechanically
                read the word, then they read and interpret the word and lastly they appreciate the language, style and
                story behind what they read.</p>
